🏡 House Price Prediction (Regression)
A Machine Learning project to predict house prices based on various features using Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
📌 Project Overview
This project uses regression techniques to predict house prices based on multiple factors such as:
✔️ Area
✔️ Number of Bedrooms & Bathrooms
✔️ Stories
✔️ Availability of Features (Main Road, Basement, Air Conditioning, etc.)

Models Implemented:
✅ Decision Tree Regressor
✅ Random Forest Regressor

🔍 Performance Comparison: We evaluate both models and optimize performance using Hyperparameter Tuning.
